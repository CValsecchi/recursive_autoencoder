Used semi-supervised recursive autoencoders to learn sentence meanings and predict polarity of movie reviews. Achieved an accuracy of 72% with random word initialization on movie reviews dataset from rottentomatoes.

Based on Richard Socher's work as described in the paper "Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoders for Predicting Sentiment Distributions" and their MATLAB code for the same.
